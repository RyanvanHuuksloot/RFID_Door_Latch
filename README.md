# RFID Door Latch

Our project is designed as a RFID controlled access door locking system. A card needs to be presented and at which time, if the card is recognized, the lock will open for a short period of time and then lock again. Our system uses an Arduino uno as a control board, an RFID Control Shield to scan RFID cards, a micro servo to turn a deadbolt lock, and a NeoPixel LED display.

## Getting Started

Download the repository. Download Arduino Sketch. Open the .ino file with the Arduino and ensure the libraries are in the right spot.

### Prerequisites

Arduino Sketch
Libraries Required: LPD8806, Adafruit-PN532 and Adafruit_NeoPixel

### Installing

Simple download to a location on your computer should suffice.

## Running the tests

Use an Arduino Uno with an RFID shield (PN532), 8 pixel LED light and a servo motor. Pin numbers are within the .ino file.

### Break down into end to end tests
<!- Check arduino documentation or adafruit documentation, it is a simple project so any explanation will likely need more than I can give here -!>
